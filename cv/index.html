          <article id="statement">
            <p>I am a former graduate student of Mathematical Physics, Private Tutor, and freelance programmer that desires to use my problem solving, analysis, and understanding
               of complex systems skills in a programming career role. I have many years of programming experience working on various projects created for my interests or during my degrees.
              I adore the freedom of invention that programming allows and, in my spare time, I continue to push my skills further.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Programmer Experience:</h2>
            <p>I started applying for programming career roles after years of hobbyist programming and some experience with small freelance jobs. The <a href="../index.html" target="_blank">homepage</a> of this website acts as my portfolio.
              There I have laid out examples of what I can do in programming. I am adding to this page as I learn new skills.
            </p>
            <p>As a freelance programmer I mainly give consulation to learners on Python or web development.
              I have also done work with data cleaning, analysis, and presentation.</p>
