        <h1>Mark Platts Software Portfolio</h1>
        <h2>I'm Mark Platts, Developer, Engineer, and Automation Tester with an obsession with figuring out how things work!</h2>
        <p>This is where I keep together any projects, experiments, or educational tools that I wish to show others.</p>
        <p>Everything here is designed to show off something. In fact the first portfolio piece is this portfolio itself! I hand coded all the web files in order to get a great intuition for how HTML, JS, and CSS fit together. I then developed a cloud deployment strategy by creating two GitHub Actions Workflows. Once builds the public facing site by aggregating the portfolio files and my web app files. The other gets called when I update one of my web apps and triggers the first to bring the portfolio up to date with a rebuild.</p>
        <p>There are two types of portfolio piece on here:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Web Apps - The link takes you to the app itself so that you can explore it. At the bottom of the page is an explanation of the work and a link to the repo</li>
          <li>Code Pieces - For these, the link takes you straight to the repo where an explanation and example pictures/videos are provided in the README.md</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All code for this portfolio was written by me to be a true representation of my abilties. However it is worth noting that some code was written before I became a professional developer and is in need of an update. I am currently actively working through all pieces to modernise them to my current standards. But feel feel to take a look!</p>

        <h2>Explanation for this page:</h2>
        <p>This page was a testing ground for many ideas.
          I wanted a page with a nice but minimilist layout that could easily collapse in a neat way for smaller screens. I used flexbox to achieve that. 
        I also used this page to find the general feel of the website, including the colour scheme, font families, and the way the nav bar and footbar work.</p>
