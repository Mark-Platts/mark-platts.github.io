        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am Mark Platts, I'm 28 years old. My background is in Mathematical Physics and Private Tutoring,
          but I am now working hard towards a career in programming. I would consider any programming role as they all interest me for different reasons.
          However, I would be most happy in a job with a lot of things to learn and complex problems to solve. <br><br>
          Also, I am currently still a private tutor for hire. Feel free to contact me regarding tutoring jobs.
        </p>

          <h3>What makes you tick?</h3>
          <p>I have always had an obsession with understanding how things work and learning in general. This led me to study physics and mathematics so that I could get
            a fundamental understanding of how everything else works. In my spare time I have studied a variety of topics that themselves form complex systems.
            These include: linguistics and languages, engineering, computer science, chess, strategy, military theory, music theory, and more. From all of these topics I
            enjoy the feeling of understanding how it all works and fits together.
              Programming was an amazing discovery for me due to the fact that not only is it itself a deep and meaningful endevour,
            but it also lends itself to so many other areas. I began learning to code in order to explore areas of maths and physics and to learn
            how games work. Before long I discovered how fascinating programming is for its own sake and I started challenging myself to learn to
            do more and more.</p>

        <article id="interests">
          <h3>Interests:</h3>
          <p>My main interests are mathematics, physics, and programming. I have a deep love for figuring out how things work which eventually led to
            my MSc in Mathematical Physics. I now continue to work towards a general understanding of the current theories of physics and when I have time
            I push my understanding of different areas in pure mathematics. Right now though the bulk of my time is spent exploring as many programming
            tools as I can to add to my belt. Whilst programming started off as a useful tool in my other endevours, I have since seen the endless possibilities
            that it allows and I have fallen in love with the process of turning an idea into a final product. <br><br> 
            For a more detailed look at my main (and most relevant) interests:
          </p><br>
          <h3>Mathematics and Physics:</h3>
          <ul style="list-style-position: inside; padding:10px 20px;">
            <li><b>Quantum Theory:</b> My MSc laid a good foundation here that I wish to expand upon as time goes on.
            I am mainly working towards a better understanding of Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Loop Quantum Gravity.
          I am also experimenting right now with visualising Quantum Mechanics with code generated animations. I have many ideas for how to use programming 
        to make this daunting topic more accessible, especially to early students of quantum ideas.</li>
            <li><b>Geometry:</b> I love geometry in general but am fascinated by its higher dimensional generalisations.
            I am working towards a better understanding of algebraic geometry, group theory, lie-algebras, differential geometry, and applications of
          higher dimensional geometry to systems analysis. I have created a web app (link) that shows off the 4-dimensional convex regular polytopes,
        and now I am experimenting with using machine learning to approximate ellipses that fit given data. Eventually, I hope to return to
        experiments in programming differential forms for use in research inspired by my dissertation. Finally, I have now seen the importance 
      of higher dimensional geometry in minimising loss in machine learning. I am hoping to bring tools from different areas of higher maths and 
    physics to my machine learning experiments.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Programming:</h3>
          <ul style="list-style-position: inside; padding:10px 20px;">
            <li><b>UI Design and Engineering:</b> I still remember when I first learned the power of adding an interface to my code.
            At first, I used it to build many game interfaces. Now I use it to build web apps for anything I feel would be useful (usually to my students).
          I am still deeply fascinated by how much you can do with JavaScript and CSS and I like the challenge of figuring out how to make an interface do something interesting.
            </li>
            <li><b>Numerics and Calculators:</b> Maths and Physics contain a lot interesting ideas that require an intense or even infinite amount of calculation effort. 
              I find myself often writing scripts to take care of these unmanagable calculations so that I can see the results of things that I would never be 
              able to do by hand or with a typical calculator. You can see an example of this in the explanation for my Convex Regular Polytop Renderer (link).
            </li>
            <li><b>Machine Learning:</b> I have been fascinated by this area for many years and I have a lot of projects in mind once I know more. 
            I have played with different A.I. designs for games that I have built. I have also experimented with stochastic and gradient-step based machine learning 
          for different areas of mathematics. Now I am spending some of my free time learning Neural Network deep learning.</li>
            <li><b>General Software Design and Engineering:</b> As I began to gain experience with code, the amount of ideas I had for useful
              software/web apps increased. However, rather than see the programming as a means to an end, I have found that I really enjoy 
              the process of realising an idea into a working program. A lot of the ideas for my portfolio came from programs that I built for some purpose 
            of my own and each was a fun challenge to work through.</li>
            <li><b>Backend/Full stack Engineering:</b> Growing up with the internet means that I was always intrigued as to how it works. Once I started 
            to understand the logic of what goes on behind the scenes I became fascinated by the way the backend works, the power of what can be done with 
          it, and the ways that it interacts with the frontend. My Poem Helper (link) and Equation API (link) are examples of my first experiments with full stack 
        engineering, and I plan to keep adding to my toolbelt here and seeing what I can make. </li>
            <li><b>Low Level Programming:</b> Growing up with technology also meant that I wanted to understand how computers themselves work. 
            I find computer science a beautiful topic and I still remember the wonder I felt when I finally understood a basic CPU at circuit level. 
          I wish to keep exploring this area and I'm currently experimenting with low level ideas such as architectures, machine code, and assembly.
          My CPU Simulator (link) is a first step in the plans I have to create interactive web apps that show off the different levels of computer science.</li>

        <article id="whyNewCar">
          <h3>Why have you decided to change career?</h3>
          <p>For many years I have known how much I love programming. It slowly became one of my main hobbies and I worked on many
            ideas, requiring me to learn and apply new programming skills. However, I used to assume that my skills were of amature level. Truly, the only reason
            I didn't try for a programming career sooner is that I didn't realise it was accessible to me as a self-teacher.
            Eventually, I began working on collaborative ideas with my good friend <a href="http://colinbroderick.co.uk/" target="_blank">Colin Broderick</a>. He is a Systems Engineer and does programming professionally. 
            He made me realise that I was good enough to do programming as a job. I realised after that point that I would be much happier in a 
            programming role, especially an engineer/developer style one. Since then I have been working hard to learn skills that are useful to a wide range
            of programming roles, whilst also building up a portfolio to show off my work.</p>
        </article>


        <div id="imageContainer4" class="parallax imageContainerHeight"></div>

        <article id="goals">
          <h3>What role would make you happiest? What are your goals?:</h3>
          <p>In my own personal work, I am happiest when I have something that needs to be figured out/made/done and I am working out how to achieve that.
            I enjoy the process of working towards a solution with experiments here and there, and I love the satisfaction of parts coming together to 
            make something bigger/worthwhile happen. Of course, the greatest joy is when each piece clicks together and the goal is achieved. All of these things exist in 
            many programming roles, but I feel that with these ideas and my maths and physics background, I would be happiest in an engineering role. 
            Of course, the joys I have laid out also increase when the complexity of the domain increases. For now, my goal is to aim for a role as a 
            Software Engineer, or some kind of web based engineer. I enjoy many areas of programming and I love learning new skills. I like all parts of 
            the full stack in web development and I think that makes full stack developer a worthy goal in the long run. Alongside these goals, I have many ideas for software/websites that I would love to see through to 
            completion. I wish to eventually get to a point where I can realise them personally.

          <h3>What do you think are your main selling points?:</h3>
          <ul style="list-style-position: inside; padding:10px 20px;"> 
            <li>I am a fast learner and thorough too: Over a decade of self tutoring many varied subjects has allowed me to hone my abilities to take on any new subject 
              and efficiently get to grips with it. As well as this, I learn best from actually doing the subject myself and I tend to only call a skill 
            understood when I can demonstrate my ability to do it. Hence this portfolio.</li><br>
            <li>I am a self-teacher: Related to the above, most of what I know is self taught as I find I learn best that way. For a job this means that if I 
              need a skill that I don't already have, I am more than happy to go and learn it independently.
            </li><br>
            <li>I love problem solving: You can see from my <a href="#interests">interests</a> above that I gravitate towards areas with things to work out. 
            I love the feeling of getting to know a problem and the satisfaction of finding a way to solve it. I also have a lot of experience learning 
          and understanding deep and complex systems.</li><br>
            <li>I am a good communicator: Working as a tutor has given me a lot of practice in communicating complex ideas to others, even when they 
              themselves have little knowledge in the area.
            </li><br>
            <li>I prefer a thorough understanding of anything I work on as opposed to just learning the bare minimum. If I'm learning how to do something, 
              I often wish to achieve my own ideas with those skills and I work towards a general understanding that allows me to customise those skills to any needs.
            </li><br>
            <li>I am still improving: I always have the push to get better and learn more. I also always have programming ideas that force me to learn new skills 
              so that I can make them happen. Regardless of what role I am in, I will be continuing to grow as a programmer in my spare time.

        <h2>Explanation for this page:</h2>
        <p>For this page, I wanted to split each answer up so that the page was less congested. I also wanted something interesting to happen in the gaps. 
          In the end, this page became a testing ground for the parallax effect on the images between each answer. (Note: due to phone browser issues, this effect 
          only works on larger screens.)
        </p>
        <p>The pictures in order of viewing:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
          <li>A frame from my ongoing experiments in visualising Quantum Mechanics. This is the probability amplitude of a particle trapped 
            in an infinite square well potential. I am currently writing up my work so far to put on the blog part of this site.
          </li>
          <li>The Hecatonicosachoron: a perpsective projection of a 4D shape. This and other shapes can be viewed on my Regular Convex Polytope (link)
            engine.
          </li>
          <li>My first ever attempt to program visualisation of 4D shapes. This an orthographic projection of the Tesseract/Hyper Cube.</li>
          <li>A fun experiment with the Mandelbrot Set that allowed me to explore ideas in going from a continuious formula to a discrete set of pixels</li>
          <li>The interface for my Shogi Engine. This is an early picture from a current work in progress. Eventually, I plan to develope 
            this into a full website.
          </li>
          <li>A simulation of a very basic CPU. I made this to teach people how a CPU works at a 1's and 0's level. It can be programmed directly 
            with machine code. It can be found here (link). I have many plans to expand on this idea.
          </li>
          <li>A screenshot from another work in progress. This will eventually be an engine that allows me to easily show off complex 
            circuits in an interactive way. I hope to create a tour of ideas that starts with individual transistors and builds up 
            layers of complexity until the user can understand how computers work at a circuitry level.
